**Sorting Visualizer** is a web application written in `HTML/CSS` and pure `JavaScript` to visualize different sorting algorithms. The Algorithms visualized here are comparison based, specifically I chose to visualize 5 different sorting algorithms, and they are:

***1. Bubble Sort.*** \
***2. Insertion Sort.*** \
***3. Merge Sort.*** \
***4. Quick Sort.*** \
***5. Heap Sort.***

All but the Merge, and Quick Sort algorithm have a ***O(1)*** memory complexity, so no additional memory is used, which means the algorithms swap the elements around, appropriately until the list of elements is sorted in ascending order.
